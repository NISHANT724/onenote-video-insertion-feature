📝 **Update - 05 July 2025**  
I recently learned that Notion supports inline video playback — which is great.  
However, Notion does not support **handwritten notes** like OneNote does.  
So this idea still has unique value: combining **handwriting + inline video** playback on the same page.

This would help students, creators, and professionals stay more productive.
